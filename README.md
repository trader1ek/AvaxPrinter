The shared contract is a scammer contract that I wrote upon a personal request for a specific individual. Therefore, 
I have shared the contract in a non-functional manner. 
Anyone wishing to use the contract will have to copy and correct the errors, making it functional. For this reason, I bear no responsibility.
